[h1]Balance[/h1]
- Built from scratch using 1.3 Trader Defs so it is vanilla friendly / balanced.
- All Files have been hand edited to ensure balance and optimisation
- Trader stock amounts has been increased while still using the vanilla trade lists
- The amount of items and silver was kept at a sensible but greatly increased amount
- No Game Breaking ridiculous amounts of stock like 3,000 monkeys and 1,000,000 Silver
- This technically makes the game easier as items can be bought in bigger quantities.
- Robbing Caravans is now MUCH more profitable (Do with this information what you will)
- Some Rare and expensive Items quantities have only been increased slightly for balance reasons (Persona Weapons, Tech Prints, Telescopes etc..)

[h1]Notes[/h1]
- Traders prices / Trader Types / Trader frequency are unchanged.
- Highly compatible with other mods as it is just TraderDefs.xml edits.
- Safe to be added or removed from save games at anytime.

- Full support for Royalty.
- Full support for Ideology.
- Will work without Royalty, but you will just have to dismiss the load up error.
- Will work without Ideology, since it directly doesn't affect trader lists.
- Works with Rimworld Version 1.2
