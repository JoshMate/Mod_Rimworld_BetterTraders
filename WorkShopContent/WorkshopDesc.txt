[h1]This mod has been rebuilt from the ground up for Version 1.1 and the Royalty DLC[/h1]

[h1]What? [/h1]
- Makes all trader types have roughly double (+100%) the goods for sale.
- Makes all traders types have double the silver, increasing the amount they can buy from you.

[h1]How? [/h1]
- By increasing the count variables in the traderKindDefs .xml files

[h1]Why? [/h1]
- Traders will have more to offer you, making those huge late game bases more practical!
- Increases the variance of what individual traders sell without straying from the vanilla stock lists.
- Traders will be better equipped to buy your 427 thrumbo fur armchairs!
