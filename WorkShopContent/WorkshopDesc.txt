[h1]Balance[/h1]
- Built from scratch using 1.3 Trader Defs so it is vanilla friendly / balanced.
- All Files have been hand edited to ensure balance and optimisation
- Trader stock amounts has been increased while still using the vanilla trade lists
- The amount of items and silver was kept at a sensible but greatly increased amount
- No Game Breaking ridiculous amounts of stock like 3,000 monkeys and 1,000,000 Silver
- This technically makes the game easier as items can be bought in bigger quantities.
- Robbing Caravans is now MUCH more profitable (Do with this information what you will)
- Some Rare and expensive Items quantities have only been increased slightly for balance reasons (Persona Weapons, Tech Prints, Telescopes etc..)
