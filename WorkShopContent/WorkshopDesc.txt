[h1]Description[/h1]
A full overhaul of the Rimworld traders. Changes all types of traders to have more consistent personalities and ultimately have more useful items for sale.
It does it by splitting the trader types into 4 new types which have different stock depnding on the type of faction and type of interaction.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
- Traders still sell the same coverage of items as vanilla + Royalty.
- Traders prices / frequency / relations are still the same.
- Only affects the traders stock lists not factions, quest rewards or anything else regarding items.
- This technically makes the game easier as items can be bought in bigger quantities.
- Requires 1.1 and Royalty DLC.
- Highly compatable as it just TraderDefs xml edits.
