[h1]Updated to version 1.1 with optional Royalty support![h1]

[h1]What? [/h1]
Improves the quality and variances of all traders in Rimworld while still keeping the vanilla trader feel.

[h1]How? [/h1]
Makes all Caravans, Trade ships, Settlements and Visitors have exactly 2x (Double) the stock of items and silver to trade with. 

[h1]Why? [/h1]
- Makes traders less predictable and stale by increasing the variety of what they have to offer.
- Makes the late game trading more rewarding since others have more to offer you and have more silver to buy your 426 cloth armchairs.
- Makes hot items like components and steel more available for purchase for those insanely large late game bases.
- Doesn't affect balance to much, since you still have to pay for the extra items. However Silver is more useful now.

[h1]Notes: [/h1]
- Supports game version 1.1
- Will also affect Empire traders if you have the Royalty DLC installed.
- Affects all colony typeslevels (Neolithic, Outlander, Misc and Empire).
