[h1]Better Traders[/h1]

A mod that improves how much stock and silver traders have without breaking game balance or straying away from the vanilla design principles for the game.

Trade lists have been hand written and balanced to ensure you get more of what you need without every trader having unrealistic amounts of stock.

You will now be able to fuel End game colonies with much more raw resources / items and equipment.
