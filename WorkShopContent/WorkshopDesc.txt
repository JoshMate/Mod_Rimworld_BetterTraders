[h1]This mod has been rebuilt from the ground up for 1.1[/h1]

[h1]What? [/h1]
- Makes all trader types have roughly double (+100%) the goods for sale.
- Makes all traders types have double the silver, increasing the amount they can buy from you.

[h1]How? [/h1]
- By increasing the countRange variables in the traderKindDefs .xml files.
- Simple xml changes make this mod VERY compatible with other mods!

[h1]Why? [/h1]
- Traders will have more to offer you, making those huge late game bases more practical!
- Increases the variance of what individual traders sell without straying from the vanilla stock lists.
- Traders will be better equipped to buy your 427 thrumbo fur armchairs!
- Doesn't make the game wildly unbalanced like x10 would, and rare trader items are still rare.

[h1]Notes: [/h1]
- Supports game version 1.1
- Supports game version 1.0
- Supports DLC Royalty
- Was rebuilt with 1.1 and royalty base trade lists, so you won't miss out on anything new!
