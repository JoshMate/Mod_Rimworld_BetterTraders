[h1]Notes[/h1]
- Traders still sell the same coverage of items as vanilla + Royalty.
- Traders prices / frequency / relations are still the same.
- Only affects the traders stock lists not factions, quest rewards or anything else regarding items.
- This technically makes the game easier as items can be bought in bigger quantities.
- Highly compatible as it just TraderDefs xml edits.
- Will work without Royalty, but you will just have to dismiss the load up error.
- Can be installed and uninstalled at any time without the need for a new colony.
