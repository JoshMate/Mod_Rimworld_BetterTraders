- This also affects Human Slaves + Animals so traders will have more of them to sell you.
- Traders prices / Trader Types / Trader frequency are unchanged.
- This technically makes the game easier as items can be bought in bigger quantities.
- Highly compatible as it just TraderDefs.xml edits.
- Safe to be added or removed from save games at anytime.
- If you have recently opened a trade menu with a trader, you will have to wait for them to restock to see the changes.

- Will work without Royalty, but you will just have to dismiss the load up error.
